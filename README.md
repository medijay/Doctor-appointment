Online Doctor Appointment

Patients can select a desired doctor appointment date through the online platform. This project is developed using the MERN stack technology, and I have implemented various functionalities to make it a professional website. Currently, I do not have much time, but in the future, I plan to add additional functionality in the admin panel. For now, the current state is sufficient.

What Features Will You Find Here?
Dynamic home page, serving as the landing page for all users.
Admin and user dashboards.
User login page with professional handling of all kinds of validations.
Ability for a patient to select an appointment and view doctor information, as well as their own appointment information.

CRUD operations and additional features.
Responsive design with a dynamic header and preloader.
